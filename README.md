## Introduction
**Swing Puzzle Game** is an engaging sliding tile puzzle crafted with Java Swing, skillfully showcasing object-oriented design principles and a dynamic event-driven architecture. This interactive experience challenges players to skillfully rearrange shuffled tiles, constructing a coherent image, while seamlessly illustrating the application of object-oriented programming and event-driven interactions.

## Features

- Shuffle tiles at the start of the game.
- Slide tiles vertically and horizontally to solve the puzzle.
- Track the number of moves taken to solve the puzzle.
- Utilize a menu system for restarting the game, closing it, and accessing developer information.

## Technologies and Concepts

This project leverages various technologies, programming concepts, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including:
- **Java:** The primary programming language used to implement the application.
- **Java Swing**: The graphical user interface (GUI) of the Puzzle Game is built using Java's Swing library, with components designed as objects that interact through OOP principles.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The project follows an Object-Oriented Design approach, encapsulating game elements as objects with well-defined properties and behaviours.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: The game utilizes an event-driven architecture where objects interact through events and listeners, fostering loose coupling and modularity.
- **Git and GitHub:** Version control and collaborative development via Git and GitHub.
  
By embracing these technologies and OOP concepts, the project achieves a well-structured and extensible architecture.
